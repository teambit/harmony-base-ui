SCSS variable decleration for the basic colors used in our palette.  
This is only meant for building css-variables, consider using the `color-definitions` component instead.

Colors divide into these groups:

-   Primary, brand (purple)
-   Secondary (blue)
-   Complementary (pink)
-   Success (green)
-   Risk (yellow)
-   Danger (red)
-   Neutrals (gray)
-   Shadows

Each color has its own shades, scaling between 0 (lightest) and 100 (darkest),
e.g.: p20 (lightest purple), p30, p50 (base purple), p60 (highlight) p70 (darkest)
