When writing a react component, it may recieve a context provider (or similar) as a prop:
```tsx
function Agatha({ MagicProvider = 'div' }: { MagicProvider?: ReactComponent }) {
	<div>
		<MagicProvider>
			It was Agatha all along!
		</MagicProvider>
	</div>
}
```

As you can see, we use `div` as a default value for consumers without a provider.  
Noop saves the extra dom element by rendering children directly:

```tsx
function Agatha({ MagicProvider = Noop }: { MagicProvider?: ReactComponent }) {
	<div>
		<MagicProvider>
			It was Agatha all along!
		</MagicProvider>
	</div>
}
```
